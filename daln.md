title: Submit a Literacy Narrative

---
![DALN Logo](/assets/daln.png)The Digital Archive of Literacy Narratives, co-sponsered through Ohio State University and Georgia State University, is a “publicly available archive of personal literacy narratives in a variety of formats (text, video, audio) that together provide a historical record of the literacy practices and values of contributors, as those practices and values change.” At the 2015 Transitioning to College Writing Symposium, we invite you to submit your literacy narrative to the archive. Stations will be setup in the Jackson Avenue Center (location TBA). You may record audio, video, or simply use the space to type out your literacy narrative. Release forms will be available, and we’ll take care of the uploading for you.
