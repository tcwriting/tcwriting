Our theme this year is currently under development, as is much of our website, so check back frequently for updates. This year, as in years past, we have a group of energetic and thoughtful program planners from Mississippiâ€™s public and private middle school, high school, and 2- and 4-year colleges and universities who will assist us in developing a symposium program that responds to the needs of our Mississippi educators.
