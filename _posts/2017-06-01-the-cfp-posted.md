The [Call for Proposals](/cfp/) for the 2017 Transitioning to College Writing Symposium is now available! 

<!-- more -->

Our theme this year "Enduring Issues: Innovative Solutions in the Writing Classroom." Our theme is based on the realization that each year, we face some enduring issues, and each year, we learn from and encourage each other to bring innovative solutions to these issues. This year, as in years past, we have a group of energetic and thoughtful program planners from Mississippiâ€™s public and private middle school, high school, and 2- and 4-year colleges and universities who have been assisting us in developing a symposium program that responds to the needs of our Mississippi educators.

We hope you will join us in Oxford, MS for the sixth anniversary of our TCW Symposium on Thursday, October 19, and Friday, October 20, 2017. Check back soon for registration information!
