In 2013, Moore received the Ovid Vickers Award for Excellence in Teaching of English from her colleagues in the Two-Year College English Association of Mississippi (TYCAM). Her publications include: Performance Pay for Teachers (2008) and Teaching 2030 (2011, Teachers College Press). Brown at 60: In the Delta, A Dream Deferred (May 2014 Education Week); Brown v. The African American Teacher: The Lingering Effects of Inequality In The American Public School Teacher: Past, Present, and Future. (May 2014 Harvard Press); Ready or Not. In New Directions for Community Colleges (Spring 2009 Jossey/Bass, Wiley). Moore also maintains a popular education blog, TeachMoore. Kathleen Blake Yancey Florida State University Kathy Blake Yancey, Kellogg W. Hunt Professor of English and Distinguished Research Professor, focuses her research on composition studies generally; on students’ transfer of writing knowledge and practice; on creative non-fiction; on cultural studies of everyday writing; on writing assessment, especially print and electronic portfolios; and on the intersections of culture, literacy and technologies. In addition to co-founding the journal Assessing Writing and co-editing it for seven years, she is the immediate past editor of College Composition and Communication, the flagship journal in the field. She has also authored, edited, or co-edited thirteen scholarly books and two textbooks as well as over 100 articles and book chapters. Released in July 2016 is her latest volume, the edited collection A Rhetoric of Reflection, which considers reflection from multiple perspectives, including transfer, multimedia, assessment, and race and language. Her co-authored Writing across Contexts: Transfer, Composition, and Sites of Writing, released in 2014, demonstrates the efficacy of a new writing curriculum, Teaching for Transfer (TFT), and articulates a new theory of prior knowledge located in theories of assemblage, remix, and critical incidents; it won both the 2015 CCCC Research Impact Award and the 2016 Council of Writing Program Administrators Best Book Award. She has served as president or chair of several scholarly organizations: the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE); the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC); the NCTE College Section and the College Forum; the Council of Writing Program Administrators; and the South Atlantic Modern Language Association (SAMLA).

Earlier boards she has served on include the Steering Committee of the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and the Steering Committee for the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&amp;U) VALUE project focused on electronic portfolios. With Barbara Cambridge and Darren Cambridge, she leads the Inter/National Coalition on Electronic Portfolio Research (ncepr.org). Now in its eleventh year, this coalition includes over 60 institutional partners from around the world. She is also the recipient of several awards, including the Florida State Graduate Mentor Award, the Donald Murray Writing Prize, and the Purdue University Distinguished Woman Scholar Award. Her current research includes three major book projects: a co-edited collection, Assembling Composition, which will be published by the CCCC Studies in Writing and Rhetoric Series in 2017; a co-edited collection, Composition, Rhetoric, and Disciplinarity: Shadows of the Past, Issues of the Moment, and Prospects for the Future, currently under review; and a book project, The Way We Were: A Cultural History of Everyday Writing in the 20th Century United States. In addition, she is the lead PI for a 4-site study of the TFT writing curriculum supported by CCCC and CWPA Research Grants. Daniel White Mississippi College Daniel J.

He teaches Information Literacy and Writing courses at Mississippi College, and he has collaborated on online tutoring and tutor training at three MS writing centers. Title: Going Online: Building and Sustaining an Online Writing Center Session Description: Transitioning an existing writing center to offer online tutoring can be challenging: selecting synchronous or asynchronous, picking a software platform, adding additional tutor training, negotiating writer and consultant privacy. There’s a lot to consider. This session reviews the development, implementation, and revision of an ongoing, online writing center program. Emphasizing the tutor training model developed for Mississippi College, attendees will see one center’s approach to creating and sustaining an online writing center.

This year, as in years past, we have a group of energetic and thoughtful program planners from Mississippi’s public and private middle school, high school, and 2- and 4-year colleges and universities who have been assisting us in developing a symposium program that responds to the needs of our Mississippi educators. We’ll also continue with our tradition of bringing outstanding scholars of composition studies and writing center studies, and we’ll be continuing with the pre-symposium workshop we introduced at the 2016 symposium: Writing Teachers Writing, a dedicated time for writing teachers to think about their own scholarship, led by Bud Hunt (Bud the Teacher blogger), a teacher-consultant with the Colorado State University Writing Project, an affiliate of the National Writing Project, a group working to improve the teaching of writing in schools via regular and meaningful professional development.

We believe that our symposia are outstanding examples of the value of thinking collaboratively. We thank our academic and public sponsors who support the TCW Symposium. Each year, we host visiting scholars who have experience in helping students navigate their transitions to college writing successfully and who share their insights with our attendees. Additionally, we are able to offer low registration fees and travel grants for our attendees. This would not happen without the support of the University of Mississippi’s College of Liberal Arts, School of Education, Division of Outreach, University of Mississippi Writing Project, and Department of Writing and Rhetoric. Sincere thanks also for the support given us by the Mississippi Excellence in Teaching Program (METP), and the University Writing Centers. ",
