    "content": "Each year, the Department of Writing and Rhetoric, along with other UM partners, hosts a themed Transitioning to College Writing Symposium in support of writing instruction in our area Welcome to the Transitioning to College Writing Symposium website, hosted by the University of Mississippi’s Department of Writing and Rhetoric. We hope you will join us in Oxford, MS for the sixth anniversary of our TCW Symposium on Thursday, October 19, and Friday, October 20, 2017. Take some time and explore our website. We look forward to seeing you soon! Our theme this year is currently under development, as is much of our website, so check back frequently for updates. This year, as in years past, we have a group of energetic and thoughtful program planners from Mississippi’s public and private middle school, high school, and 2- and 4-year colleges and universities who will assist us in developing a symposium program that responds to the needs of our Mississippi educators. We’ll also continue with our tradition of bringing outstanding scholars of composition studies and writing center studies, and we’ll be continuing with the pre-symposium workshop we introduced at the 2016 symposium: Writing Teachers Writing, a dedicated time for writing teachers to think about their own scholarship; this event is developed and hosted by the University of Mississippi’s Writing Project, which also co-hosts the annual symposia with the Department of Writing and Rhetoric. As details for our program are confirmed, we’ll post them here. We believe that our symposia are outstanding examples of the value of thinking collaboratively. We thank our academic and public sponsors who support the TCW Symposium. Each year, we host visiting scholars who have experience in helping students navigate their transitions to college writing successfully and who share their insights with our attendees. Additionally, we are able to offer low registration fees and travel grants for our attendees. This would not happen without the support of the University of Mississippi’s College of Liberal Arts, School of Education, Division of Outreach, University of Mississippi Writing Project, and Department of Writing and Rhetoric. Sincere thanks go to our public sponsors, Macmillan Publishing and W.W. Norton, and we also appreciate the support given us by the Mississippi Excellence in Teaching Program (METP), the University Writing Centers, and Fountainhead Press. ",
