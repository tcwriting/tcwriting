        "content": "Dioscorides’ ambix (described in his De materia medica) is a helmet-shaped lid for gathering condensed mercury. For Athenaeus (~ 225 C.E.) it is a bottle or flask. For later chemists it denotes various parts of crude distillation devices. Alembic drawings appear in works of Cleopatra the Alchemist, Synesius, and Zosimos of Panopolis. There were alembics with two (dibikos) and three (tribikos) receivers.[4] According to Zosimos of Panopolis, the alembic was invented by Mary the Jewess.[5] The anbik is described by Ibn al-Awwam in his Kitab al-Filaha (Book of Agriculture), where he explains how rose-water is distilled. Amongst others, it is mentioned in the Mafatih al-Ulum (Key of Sciences) of Khwarizmi and the Kitab al-Asrar (Book of Secrets) of Al-Razi. Some illustrations occur in the Latin translations of works which are attributed to Geber.[2] Originally from Alembic - Wikipedia ",

        "content": "A pot still is a type of still used in distilling spirits such as whisky or brandy. Heat is applied directly to the pot containing the wash (for whisky) or wine (for brandy). This is called a batch distillation (as opposed to a continuous distillation). At standard atmospheric pressure, alcohol boils at 78 °C (172 °F), while water boils at 100 °C (212 °F). During distillation, the vapour contains more alcohol than the liquid. When the vapours are condensed, the resulting liquid contains a higher concentration of alcohol. In the pot still, the alcohol and water vapour combine with esters and flow from the still through the condensing coil. There they condense into the first distillation liquid, the so-called “low wines”. The low wines have a strength of about 25–35% alcohol by volume, and flow into a second still. It is then distilled a second time to produce the colourless spirit, collected at about 70% alcohol by volume. Colour is added through maturation in an oak aging barrel, and develops over time. The modern pot still is a descendant of the alembic, an earlier distillation device. ",

We hope you will join us in Oxford, MS for the sixth anniversary of our TCW Symposium on Thursday, October 19, and Friday, October 20, 2017. Take some time and explore our website. We look forward to seeing you soon! Our theme this year is currently under development, as is much of our website, so check back frequently for updates. This year, as in years past, we have a group of energetic and thoughtful program planners from Mississippi’s public and private middle school, high school, and 2- and 4-year colleges and universities who will assist us in developing a symposium program that responds to the needs of our Mississippi educators. We’ll also continue with our tradition of bringing outstanding scholars of composition studies and writing center studies, and we’ll be continuing with the pre-symposium workshop we introduced at the 2016 symposium: Writing Teachers Writing, a dedicated time for writing teachers to think about their own scholarship; this event is developed and hosted by the University of Mississippi’s Writing Project, which also co-hosts the annual symposia with the Department of Writing and Rhetoric. As details for our program are confirmed, we’ll post them here. We believe that our symposia are outstanding examples of the value of thinking collaboratively. We thank our academic and public sponsors who support the TCW Symposium. Each year, we host visiting scholars who have experience in helping students navigate their transitions to college writing successfully and who share their insights with our attendees. Additionally, we are able to offer low registration fees and travel grants for our attendees. This would not happen without the support of the University of Mississippi’s College of Liberal Arts, School of Education, Division of Outreach, University of Mississippi Writing Project, and Department of Writing and Rhetoric. Sincere thanks go to our public sponsors, Macmillan Publishing and W.W. Norton, and we also appreciate the support given us by the Mississippi Excellence in Teaching Program (METP), the University Writing Centers, and Fountainhead Press. ",
