## 2017 Call: Enduring Issues: Innovative Solutions in the Writing Classroom

The annual symposium for Mississippi’s writing teachers will be held on Thursday, October 19 and Friday, October 20 at the University of Mississippi's Oxford campus. This year’s symposium will again coincide with the National Day on Writing, sponsored by the National Writing Project. We hope you will join us for keynote speakers, workshops, and special writing events!

This year, we welcome keynote speakers Kathleen Blake Yancey, Florida State University, Bud Hunt (Bud the Teacher, Blogger) from the Colorado State University Writing Project, Renee Moore, Mississippi Delta Community College, and Daniel White, Mississippi College and Current President of Mississippi Writing Center Association.  After each keynote speaker’s address, we will break out into “conversation corners,” allowing for plenty of discussion of key issues, sharing of resources, and interactions with the keynote speakers themselves.  

Our theme this year seeks to tackle those “enduring issues” we teachers experience in the writing classroom by offering a space for teachers to have conversations and share resources that offer solutions to those persistent writing woes.  How do we help students engage in academic work, reading, listening to, discussing, and responding to the academic conversation?  How do we improve information literacy in the writing classroom?  How do we help students bridge the gaps between high school and college writing, preparing them for the academic demands at each level? And how do we encourage students to develop into lifelong writers?

We invite proposals for workshops, round tables, panel presentations, and individual presentations that engage with these and other topics of interest to writing teachers.  We invite proposals from all interested writing teachers, in middle school, high school, junior, and community college, and four-year university and college settings.  

Please consider proposals that relate to our theme and/or reflect one or more of the following topics:
* Information Literacy (includes Technology in the Writing Classroom)
* Developing as a Lifelong Writer (includes Strategies for Engaging Students in Writing and Strategies for Basic Writers)
* Bridging the Transitions in the Writing Landscape (includes Bridging the Transition from High School to College Writing / Demands of Academic Writing at Each Level / Writing Beyond the First Year / Strategies for Academic Conversation (Listening, Reading, Responding))
* Developing and Sustaining a Writing Center Program

Proposals for participating in this year’s symposium should include resources that attendees can take with them and use as they return to their classrooms.  We encourage all sessions to be interactive, provide time for attendees to ask questions and have conversations, and include either digital or print resources.  

We would also like to invite volunteers to sign up to help facilitate our “conversation corners.”  For each team, we would like one middle/high school representative, one community college representative, and one four-year university representative.
