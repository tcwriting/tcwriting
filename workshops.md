## Social Media Bios

### Leigh Eaton
I am a public school teacher with thirteen years experience. I have taught all subjects and from fifth grade through twelfth grade. I am currently teaching at Itawamba County Schools. I teach fifth grade science and social studies at Dorsey Attendance Center. I joined the National Writing Project through the University of Mississippi Writing Project in 2016. I love to integrate writing into everything I teach. I feel it gives students a chance to express themselves and find deeper meaning in the core subject matter.

### Dena Holley
My passions include reading, writing, teaching, singing, crocheting, and silently correcting the grammar of everyone who speaks to me. My family consists of a hard working, loving husband, and three beautiful, intelligent girls, ages seventeen, thirteen, and six. I graduated from The University of Mississippi with a B. A. in English Literature, and from the University of Phoenix with an M. A. in Teacher Leadership.
