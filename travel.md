## Grants
Through generous contributions from our sponsors, we are pleased to offer symposium attendees the opportunity to apply for a symposium grant.

While anyone registered for the symposium may apply for a grant, we prioritize recipients by a combination of factors that include but are not limited to distance traveled, teacher access to professional development funds, school district policy regarding substitute pay, whether the applicant is a new or returning symposium attendee, and the date of application. Up to 20 symposium grants may be awarded.

The deadline to apply for a 2017 grant is Friday, October 20, 2017.  All recipients must attend the symposium in order to qualify for a travel grant; grants will be processed after the symposium ends on October 20, 2017. Recipients of travel grants will receive a check from the University of Mississippi via postal service between November 15 and December 15, 2017. Graduate students are eligible to apply.

Questions regarding travel grants should be sent to [transitioning@olemiss.edu](transitioning@olemiss.edu); phone call inquiries should be directed to 662-915-2121.
