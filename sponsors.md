Recognizing that learning is a process that needs constant attention and refinement, the Center works to promote an ongoing, university-wide discussion about teaching and learning issues. It is essential that faculty be engaged in dialogue about teaching and learning issues so that we can continue to adapt to the changing technology, student body, and understanding in our fields.
